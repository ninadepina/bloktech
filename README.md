# üëã Welcome to Pawfinder: adopt a pet!
_A platform designed to help foster pets find their new home._
The concept is like a tinder for (foster) pets and (potential) owners. Shelters can sign up pets. Users (potential owners) can start swiping on the pets. When they see a pet they like, or dislike them. All the liked dogs will be shown in a list, that can later be refound. You can chat with the shelters of your liked pets and you will be provided with more information. I will be making a signup/login feature for this application.
