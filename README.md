## Concept
A matching app for dogs that are looking for an owner, and people who are looking to adopt a dog.
- **Target audience:** everyone (18+) who is looking to adopt a dog, and shelters who want to put their dog(s) up for adoption
- **Look and feel of the application:** modern, simple, clean
- **Main user interactions:** swipe, chat, (dis)like, refind like, remove like

## Job Stories
**When I** am looking to adopt a dog **I want** to be able to contact the current owner/shelter **so I** can ask any questions I may have.
**When I** match with a dog **I want** to be able to look back on that later **so I** don't have to decide right away if I want the dog or not.
**When I** am looking to adopt a dog **I want** to be able to make an account without any problems **so I** can fully focus on the dogs.
